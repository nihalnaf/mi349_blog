                Hello! My name is Nafshiyat Nihal. I am a senior at Michigan State University
                studying computer science. I started off as a mechanical engineering major during my
                first year, but I ended up switching my major to computer sciene after teaching
                myself Java because I realized that I loved it. Currently, I am a student co-op at 
                DTE Energy on the scheduling and coordination team. In the future, I hope to become 
                a software engineer at a FAANG company.
            <p>

                As for my hobbies, I like:
            </p> 
            <ul>
                <li>Working out</li>
                <li>Travelling</li>
                <li>Playing videogames</li>
                <li>Playig guitar</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I started learning guitar 3 years ago, and I am fully self-taught as I learned through
                YouTube and reading guitar tablature. Playing guitar is one of my favorite hobbies because
                it allows me to be creative and helps me destress from my computer science work.

                When I have free time, I liked playing videogames. Lately, I haven't really been
                playing any due to my busy schedule, but in the summer, I played a lot of Old School
                Runescape and Valorant. Games are pretty cool, but I don't seem to have much time
                for them nowadays. Hopefully, that changes in the future.

                I am taking this class because I am interested in web development, and I heard that
                this class was quite fun. So far, I have been enjoying it, and I am excited to learn
                more in MI 349!
