                Back in middle school, I watched my first anime. My first anime was Attack on
                Titan. Since then, I have watched many more animes, but Attack on Titan remains
                to be my favorite. Currently, Attack on Titan is in the process of finishing its
                last installment which is Season 4. Season 4 is divided into 3 parts, and the 3rd
                part is set to release in 2023. However, the manga has been finished a while ago,
                and I already read that to find out the ending.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most people did not like the ending.
                I also thought it wasn't amazing, but I am pretty sure that Season 4 of the animation
                might have a different ending from the manga. This is good news for watchers as we may
                be able to see a new and better ending in the anime. Many watchers were kind of annoyed
                that the studio is taking a long time to finish Season 4 and dividing it up into so many
                parts. They claim that the studio just wants to extend it to make more money, but I have
                a different idea. I think it is good that the studio is dragging hte season out because
                otherwise, the animation would have felt too rushed. There are a lot of things to cover
                from the manga, and breaking it up into many different parts will allow for the animation
                to be better quality.

            <h3>Blog Post 2: Guitar</h2>
            <p>10/10/2022</p>
            <p>By Nafshiyat Nihal</p>

                One of my favorite hobbies currently is playing the guiatr. I started playing guitar in July 2019
                which is when I purchased the Yamaha FG800 for $200. This was a very good beginner guitar as it
                is budget-friendly and has a solid wood top which is not something you tend to find on cheap guitars.
                Prior to learning guitar, I have not any musical experience. This was my first instrument. I was
                fully self-taught. I started off watching YouTube videos, and then I transitioned into learning
                how to read some sheet music and guitar tablature. Guitar tablature is very easy to read as it
                is much simpler than sheet music. I primarily play fingerstyle guitar which is different from playing 
                chords as fingerstyle guitar involves plucking the individual strings. As I got better, I started
                incorporating percussion by slapping the strings and beating the wood on the guitar while playing
                to add some more flavor.
            </p>

                I love playing guitar as it gives me a way to destress after work and coding. After sitting in
                front of a computer screen all day, it feels nice to be creative and learn some new arrangements
                or create some myself. I also tie in playing guitar with my computer science as I have made some
                personal projects related to guitar. For example, I created a Python program that allows users to 
                create guitar tablature and output it into a text file. In the future, when I have more money, I
                hope to purchase a new guitar and maybe also get into playing electric guitar.
